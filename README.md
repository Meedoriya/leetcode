## About

This repository is a reflection of my learning process. As a beginner, I aim to:

- Develop problem-solving skills
- Understand basic algorithms and data structures
- Practice coding consistently

Problems will be categorized by difficulty and topic as I progress:

- **Easy**: To build confidence and grasp fundamental concepts.
- **Medium**: To challenge myself and deepen my understanding.

## Structure

The repository will be organized as follows:

```
LeetCode-Solutions/
│
├── Easy/
│   ├── problem1.java
│   ├── problem2.java
│   └── ...
│
├── Medium/
│   ├── problem1.java
│   ├── problem2.java
│   └── ...
│
├── README.md
└── NOTES.md  # Personal notes, observations, and lessons learned.
```

Each problem file will include:

- Problem description (summary)
- My approach and thought process
- Code implementation
- Basic time and space complexity analysis (as I learn)

---

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Java (starting point) 
- **Tools**: 
  - LeetCode Playground
  - Local IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)

## Goals

As a beginner, my goals are:

- Solve at least one problem a day
- Learn from mistakes and revise my solutions
- Gradually attempt more challenging problems
- Stay consistent and enjoy the process!
